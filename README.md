Welcome to our repository (repo) for the TRBP! All of the code used to generate the results described in the attached document and summarized below can be found in this repo. 

*As a a proof of principle, we show that our pipeline identifies previously validated transcription factors (TFs) as co-regulators of
a set of known VSMC contractile genes (Myh11, Acta2, Tagln, and Cnn1). We also propose a novel set of
co-regulated genes, whose functional role in VSMC contractility is supported in transcriptomic analyses of
murine atherosclerotic lesions. Next, we create a mutated Myh11 promoter in silico to demonstrate how our
pipeline can help predict changes to TF regulatory mechanisms after mutating cis elements in genes of
interest. Finally, we offer a feature that helps users identify orthologous TFs and co-regulated gene sets
between humans and mice. We hope that the results of our pipeline will help identify novel transcriptional
regulatory networks in VSMCs that can be therapeutically targeted for the treatment of advanced
atherosclerosis.*
